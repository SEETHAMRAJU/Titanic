# Titanic
This is my practice solution to the Titanic : Learning from a Disaster in kaggle.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a program for predicting the survival of passengers in the Titanic Disaster using som data. It is an open problem in kaggle . I have referred https://www.kaggle.com/anaskad/step-by-step-solving-titanic-problem/notebook for the code as this the my first program in ML so a large part of the code looks similar. 



Tools
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have used the funciton in scipy like RandomForest Classifier ,  Logistic regression , and SVM to predicts and then combined the results of all the three. Pandas was used for data cleaning and also numpy , matplotlib and also sklearn in python.
